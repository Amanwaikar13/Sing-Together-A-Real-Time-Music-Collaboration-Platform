## About the Project

### Real-Time Collaboration
Developing features for real-time music collaboration, enabling users to sing and hear each other instantly. This feature aims to create a seamless and interactive musical experience for users, allowing them to collaborate in real-time from different locations.

### Group and Solo Singing
Users can sing in groups or solo and create a group, becoming the owner of the group. Other users can join as members. The group owner can customize or add the type of song, which will be mentioned as the title, and set the number of joiners in the group. The owner can select or play the song.

### Recording Functionality
